Women in Data hosted a datathon highlighting on 
+ Equal Pay
+ Paid Family Leave
+ Education

We gravitated towards Paid Family Leave. In the last 5-10 years we have seen many companies revise paid leave policies for the better. Most companies have room for improvement but we wanted to analyze the progress made in companies, specifically large companies.

We then looped through the list and scraped the reviews along with some metadata about the review. [See this notebook for the code](https://github.com/monipip3/women_in_data_datathon/blob/main/Scraping_Glassdoor_Company_Reviews_parental_leave_only.ipynb).
